# Gordon
The monkey

This is an interpreter for a Monkey-based language, Gordon, from Ball Thorsten's great [Writing An Interpreter In Go](https://interpreterbook.com) book.
As I have personal interest in compiler / language design theory, and since this is not my only attempt at writing a full interpreter, I intend on extending the language beyond the one described in the book.

### Monkey extensions
Features and characteristics going beyond the ones described in the book.

[x] Real numbers with automatic casting
[x] Caret operator
[ ] "typeof" operator
[ ] Exception throwing and handling
[ ] Algebraic effects (maybe?)
[ ] Etc.
